# Ember Calculator

There are many like it but this one is mine and it represents my first foray into programming with Ember. Built after work over three nights this week the calculator itself works when used with a mouse, I was unable to test with a keyboard, and the route is set up for the theme switch but I was getting a CORS error back from the S3 link. Styling was done using SASS and overall code was done using the latest and greatest techniques that I have learned, both before and during this exercise. The unfinished product is certainly not where I would have preferred it to have been for final submission, but overall I am happy with the progress I made in the time available.
